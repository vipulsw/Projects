# Segmentation
Preprocessed raw breast ultrasound images (BUIs) by converting them into NumPy arrays for further analysis.
Developed segmentation maps using U-Net to enhance the interpretability of image labels.
Classified images into normal, benign, and malignant categories based on segmentation results.
Built a user-friendly web application using Streamlit to showcase the classification process and results.
Authored a detailed blog on Medium to document and share the project's workflow and findings.
